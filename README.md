# Katie: Transparency Server

Key Transparency (KT) is a safe, publicly-auditable way to distribute public
keys for end-to-end encryption. More generally, the same technology can also be
used for tamper-evident logging, key usage detection, ensuring that a group of
users agree on a shared value, and many other applications.
